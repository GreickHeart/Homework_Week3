# Homework_Week3

--Foreword--
Though this does not excuse the quality of the work I have submitted, I wish to provide some context for the state of this code. This past week has been particuarly challenging due to my work schedule outside of the course. I have not been able to devote as much time as I would have liked to this assignment, and to my studies as a whole. The extra work hours coupled with the increased intensity of the boot camp, my own personal struggles, as well as very little sleep, combined in a very ugly way. While my inability to complete this assignment is incredibly disheartening, I have begun to take steps to avoid getting into a situation like the one I found myself in last week.
------------

This Week we were tasked with creating a password generator in javascript. I began by researching other password generators made in javascript, to see if I could work my way through the finished code, learn how it functioned, and recreate it. I found the finished product of a graduate from the bootcamp on github, and attempted to base my initial designs off of his code (I have linked his github in the "Credits" section of this README). I also found a very helpful website on which a front end developer by the name of Joel Olawanle wrote a walkthrough of how to create a password generator in javascript. Though his program did exactly what I was looking for, I did not understand many of the shortcuts and tricks he used in his full code. I never use code from another developer unless I can understand and create it myself, and I could not do that with his. Still, it was an interesting read.

In the assigment requirements, we were asked to present the user with password specifications after they press the generate button, and in early testing with that model I found that it wasn't satisfactory. It forced the user to reassign their specifications everytime they wanted to generate a new password, rather than adjust one or two variables on the fly, which I thought was far more user friendly. This lead to me attempting to use checkboxes to declare character types true or false, and to deny their use in the generation function. I had plans to use a slider to set the length of the password, as the first finished generator I found made it exceptionally smooth, however I had trouble properly utilizing it. I eventually removed the slider, though I did not design another way to set the password length.

Thank you for reading, and feel free to look at either of the developers I linked in this README for your password generating needs.
